# Cub3D

Cub3D is a 3D game engine project developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. This project involves creating a basic raycasting engine, inspired by classic games like Wolfenstein 3D, to render a simple 3D environment from a 2D map.

## Overview

Cub3D is designed to give you hands-on experience with the fundamentals of computer graphics and game development. You'll develop a basic understanding of raycasting, a technique used to create a 3D perspective in a 2D game, and you'll implement this in C.

## Features

- Basic 3D rendering using raycasting
- Textured walls and sprites
- Simple movement and collision detection
- Configurable maps through `.cub` files
- Basic game loop and user interface

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- GCC or Clang (for compiling the C code)
- `make` (for building the project)
- X11 libraries (for graphical output on Linux)
- `mlx` library (MiniLibX, provided by 42)

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rboutaik/cub3d.git
   cd cub3d
